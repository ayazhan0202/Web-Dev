<h1>Great Big Words</h1>
<h2>by Michael Mark & Tom Chapin</h2>

<p>When I was a little kid,
a "<em class="big">diminutive juvenile</em>," <br>
I liked my folks to read to me,
I was an <em class="big">"eager bibliophile."</em> <br>
Now I love words for how they sound <br>
And how they <em class="big">"communicate."</em> <br>
Perhaps I should explain myself,
that is, <em class="big">"elucidate."</em> <br>
Great big words, I like <em class="big">big</em> words. <br>
Letter by letter, the <em class="bigger">bigger</em> the better <br>
Great big words. La la la la la la la la la la!</p>
